## To run the code:
1. Run "npm install" in root project folder
2. "cd android" then run "gradlew clean" until it works
3. "cd .." then "npx react-native run-android"

In "index.js", on line "AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => x);" replace x with "Login" to enable login process; or with "App" to view and test App.js directly

## Login requirements
You should be able to run anything in the code now since it's in the webhost server now.
